# CMS Authentication Setup

## Path A (Recommended): DecapBridge
1. Create a site in DecapBridge.
2. Set the CMS login URL to `https://YOURDOMAIN/admin/index.html`.
3. Invite exactly 3 collaborators by email.
4. Copy the backend configuration snippet generated by DecapBridge.
5. Paste it into `/admin/config.yml` in the “DecapBridge block” and remove the git-gateway backend.

## Path B (Legacy): Netlify Identity + Git Gateway
Note: Netlify Identity is deprecated. Use this only if your Netlify account already relies on it.

1. In Netlify, enable Identity and Git Gateway for the site.
2. Disable open signup. Invite exactly 3 collaborators by email.
3. Confirm `backend: { name: git-gateway, branch: main }` remains active in `/admin/config.yml`.
4. Visit `https://YOURDOMAIN/admin/` and log in.
