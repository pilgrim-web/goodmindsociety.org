  "about_hero_intro": "A calm, people-centered nonprofit serving communities with respect and patience.",
  "about_intro_title": "Our story in 50 sentences",
  "about_p1": "GoodMind Society began as a small circle of listeners. We noticed that many learners needed a slower pace. We also saw caregivers seeking gentle support. Our first meetings were simple and quiet. We wrote down what people asked for most. Clear guidance was one request. Another request was a sense of belonging. We chose to grow with care. We set modest goals and kept them visible. That early rhythm still guides us.",
  "about_p2": "We believe learning is a lifelong practice. We treat every person with patience and dignity. We plan programs that can be repeated locally. We keep instructions clear for volunteers. We keep expectations realistic for partners. We welcome feedback without defensiveness. We document what works and what needs change. We celebrate progress without exaggeration. We stay open to different learning styles. We remain grounded in the communities we serve.",
  "about_p3": "Our work often starts with a conversation. We ask what helps people feel safe to learn. We map small steps that fit daily life. We connect learners with mentors who listen well. We invite local groups to shape the program. We protect time for reflection and rest. We aim for steady improvement, not rush. We use simple tools that are easy to maintain. We keep records so others can replicate the work. We share lessons openly when invited.",
  "about_p4": "GoodMind Society is a nonprofit without a loud image. We focus on reliability instead of spectacle. We show up when we say we will. We keep communication honest and direct. We respect privacy and personal boundaries. We seek partnerships built on trust. We design activities that are low-cost and flexible. We look for ways to remove stress from learning. We notice small wins and name them. We keep listening as needs change.",
  "about_p5": "Our team includes volunteers, advisors, and community partners. Each role is defined so people know what to expect. We invite new voices into planning. We train with care and check in often. We share resources so others can lead. We measure success by steady participation. We hold ourselves accountable to our mission. We learn from missteps and adjust. We keep our doors open to collaboration. We are here for the long term.",
